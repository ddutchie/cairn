/**
 * A curtain of light draped over the top of the screen, rays rippling as if in
 * a slow breeze, with more of it hidden above the top edge than is on show.
 * Drag down and the hidden part follows your finger into view.
 *
 * Every constant here was measured off a real curtain rather than chosen by eye,
 * and the notes at each one say what the measurement was. The four that matter
 * most:
 *
 *   - the light is a plateau above the screen's top edge which falls to nothing
 *     by 0.235 screen-heights below it, half-bright at 0.13, and the falloff is
 *     close to linear through its middle rather than an S-curve,
 *   - it is violet throughout — blue > red > green — never green or warm,
 *   - the rays lean, and the lean always opposes the direction the field is
 *     drifting, which is why it comes from a time lag down each ray instead of
 *     a slant drawn into them,
 *   - nothing about the field is periodic. Evenly spaced rays put all their
 *     energy at the spacing's frequency and read as regularly spaced vertical
 *     lines; the real thing has a horizontal spectrum that decays smoothly with
 *     no peak anywhere, so the centres are scattered and the widths vary widely.
 *
 * Every speed is a whole-number multiple of the master clock, so the 14-second
 * loop is seamless with a linear, non-reversing repeat.
