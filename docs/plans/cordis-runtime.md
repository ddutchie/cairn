> done vs pending, how to run the live tests, and the next concrete step.

## 1. Goal

Make the **Cairn Cordis runtime the single, default engine** behind Cairn's chat + agent surfaces, so Cairn stops maintaining its own agent loops entirely. Cairn boots its own Cordis tree **in-process in Electron main**, consumes the dsh stack (`dsh-agent-loop` orchestrator + `dsh-llm-pi-ai` model transport + dsh capability plugins for plan-mode/bash/fs/subagents/approvals/sandbox), and writes **small `cairn-*` plugins** for every Cairn-specific concern — each parity gap is a plugin, not a fork.

**Strategy decision (2026-08-19):** Cordis is **default**. The built-in loops (`chat-loop.ts`, `pi-agent-loop.ts`, `chat-subagent-loop.ts`) become **frozen legacy** — reachable via an advanced setting/env var for rollback only, never developed in parallel. Delete them + the toggle once parity lands.

**The core idea:** every gap = a `cairn-*` plugin on the shared tree:
- `cairn-subagent` — bridge dsh subagent events → renderer `chat:subagent*` IPC
- `cairn-usage` — dsh usage/chunk events → `recordLlmUsage` + `chat:usage` + credit recovery
- `cairn-reasoning` — reasoning chunks → round-trip metadata on `chat_messages`
- `cairn-session` — dsh session events → `chat_threads`/`chat_messages` persistence
- `cairn-tools` — Cairn's ~56 data tools onto `ctx.tools` (done)
- `cairn-llm` — pi-ai adapter + profile for Cairn's endpoints (done)

## 2. Proof of concept (done — `scratch/dsh-spike/`)

### Spike 1 — npm consumability + tool registry — PASS
- `npm install @deepseek-ai/cordis @deepseek-ai/dsh-tools` resolves and installs in plain Node.
- A Cordis `Context` boots in-process; mounting `dsh-session`, `dsh-llm`, `dsh-system-prompt`, `dsh-agent`, `dsh-tools` (awaiting each fiber) registers `ctx.tools`.
- A tool defined with `defineTool` registers and executes through the full pipeline (`ctx.tools.execute` → pre-execute → guards → execute → post-execute → result) with cancellation signal support.

### Spike 2 — real end-to-end agent loop — PASS
- Wrote a minimal `LlmAdapter` subclass implementing the dsh-llm adapter seam against any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (used `http://localhost:3042/v1`, Rork bridge, model `claude-sonnet-4-5`).
- Booted the same Cordis tree, registered a real Cairn data tool (`cairn_list_notes`) backed by the **real** `getNotes` query from `electron/db/queries.js` on an in-memory DB with the real schema.
- Ran a manual agent loop: user message → model called `cairn_list_notes` → tool executed against SQLite → result fed back → model produced the correct final answer listing the seeded notes.
- **Proves:** the adapter seam is implementable (this is the `cairn-llm` port), and the tool bridge is nearly free (real query functions drop straight into a tool body).

### Key findings / risks surfaced
1. **npm distribution is incomplete.** `dsh-base` (the full bundle) fails to install — it depends on unpublished packages (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-environment`, `dsh-bash-env`, `dsh-tasks`) that 404. `dsh-skill-local` is also unpublished.
2. **Version drift across rc lines.** Packages publish at different rc versions (e.g. `dsh-tools` 0.0.1-rc.1 vs `dsh-agent-loop` 0.1.0-rc.6); caret ranges resolve a mixed tree. Consumers must pin the exact coherent snapshot from dsh's own lockfile, not trust ranges.
3. **Core loop is consumable today; capability plugins are not all consumable yet.** The 5 core packages (`cordis`, `dsh-llm`, `dsh-session`, `dsh-system-prompt`, `dsh-agent`, `dsh-tools`) install and run. `dsh-agent-loop` (the orchestrator) and several capability plugins pull missing deps.
4. **The tool registry API is more rigorous than Cairn's.** Every tool needs a mandatory typed output schema + render projection — a real (small) migration cost for the ~45 built-in tools, but it buys consistent replayable presentation for free.

## 3. Architecture

```
Cairn Electron main (in-process, no subprocess, no protocol bridge)
└── @deepseek-ai/cordis Context (ctx)  ← default engine
    ├── dsh core: session, llm, system-prompt, agent, tools, agent-loop, scope,
    │   llm-retry, agent-default-model, llm-pi-ai
    ├── dsh capability plugins: plan-mode, permission-presets, user-approval,
    │   sandbox-local/policy, fs-sandbox, shell-env, subprocess-local, bash-local,
    │   tool-bash/fs/fs-search/str-replace/todo, agent-instructions, subagent,
    │   compaction-basic, token-meter, commands
    └── Cairn's own plugins (the parity layer — one per concern, not a fork)
        ├── cairn-db             — existing db handle + queries (ABI-safe)
        ├── cairn-llm            — pi-ai adapter + profile for Cairn's endpoints (done)
        ├── cairn-tools          — ~56 data tools onto ctx.tools (done)
        ├── cairn-external-tools — user MCP servers + custom services onto ctx.tools
        ├── cairn-session        — dsh session events → chat_threads/chat_messages (+ reasoning field)
        ├── cairn-usage          — dsh usage → recordLlmUsage + chat:usage + credit recovery
        ├── cairn-subagent       — dsh subagent events → chat:subagent* IPC
        └── cairn-community      — personalities / slash commands / automations onto the tree
```

**Non-negotiable invariants:**
- `Database` is still constructed only in `electron/db/client.ts` and the MCP runtime — the ABI rules in AGENTS.md stay untouched.
- The renderer keeps talking the exact same IPC surface (`chat:stream` / `chat:token` / `chat:tool-call` / `chat:done`). Only the engine call site changes.
- Chat messages still land in `chat_threads` / `chat_messages` (SQLite), so the mobile SSE bridge, pop-out window, and PreviewPane keep working with zero UI changes.

## 4. Phased rollout (aggressive — Cordis default, frozen fallback)

### Phase 0 — Stabilize the dependency baseline (DONE 2026-08-19)
- [x] Core tree installs and runs at the coherent **0.1.0-rc.8** snapshot (all 32 deps; `@deepseek-ai/cordis@4.0.1`). See pinned matrix in `package.json`.
- [x] Chat engine swap proven end-to-end (get_active_context → real SQLite → answer).
- [x] Full coding toolset mounts on rc.8: bash, read, write, edit, glob, grep, str_replace_editor, todo_write, exit_plan_mode.
- [x] 5 packages remain unpublished (`dsh-environment`, `dsh-bash-env`, `dsh-tasks`, `dsh-skill-local`, `dsh-cordis`) — none needed for the core/coding stack; revisit when adopting workflows/skills.

### Phase 1 — Cordis default + parity plugins (DONE ✅)
- [x] Flip the engine default to `cordis`; built-in is frozen legacy (`CAIRN_ENGINE=builtin` env, or the `localllm` provider). (`cd0d0882`)
- [x] `cairn-session` — persist dsh session events → `chat_threads`/`chat_messages` incl. reasoning (**no cairn-reasoning plugin** — dsh round-trips reasoning natively). (`7926d14e`)
- [x] `cairn-usage` — usage → `chat:usage` + `recordLlmUsage`. (credit recovery still TODO — minor)
- [x] `cairn-subagent` — dsh subagent events → `chat:subagent*` IPC. (`b452b484`; thinking/brief split fixed `f08b125d`)
- [x] `cairn-external-tools` — user MCP servers + custom services onto `ctx.tools`. (`f4e48739`)
- [x] Fix bundle-guard + native-deps-guard + footprint. (`cd0d0882`)
- [x] **Bonus fixes (post-flip):** `import.meta.url` CJS-bundling crash (`7e16808c`); system-prompt + history injection + live token/reasoning streaming (`d1d6c2bf`); reasoning via completions (`636eac1e`); system-prompt as a plugin (`3259f35b`); **auto responses/completions probe-and-cache + runtime fallback** (`4dee51f4`).

### Phase 1.5 — Port the CODING AGENT to Cordis (IN PROGRESS — the real Phase-2 blocker)

The chat loop is ported. The **coding agent** (`electron/ipc/pi-agent.ts` + `electron/lib/pi-agent-loop.ts`, driven by `runAgentLoop`) is still 100% on the built-in stack and is far richer than chat (plan mode, HITL approvals, doom-loop, retries, compaction, skills, stateful sessions, cwd/bash/fs tools). It CANNOT be deleted until ported. This phase builds `runCordisCodingLoop` + a `cairn-coding` bridge, mirroring the `pi-agent:*` IPC contract exactly (renderer + mobile stay unchanged).

**Contract to preserve (from the audit):** `pi-agent:*` IPC — inbound `prompt/abort/approve-plan/compact-now/set-mode/respond-tool/respond-doom-loop/respond-questions/clear/destroy/preview-prompt/restore-context/is-running`; outbound `token/thought/tools-ready/tool/tool-confirm-required/doom-loop/note-updated/todos/step/usage/retry/compact/compact-result/done/error/plan-note/mode-change/ask-questions/subagent`.

Sub-steps (roughly in order):
- [x] **2a — Coding toolset mount.** `mountCodingStack` (`electron/cordis/cordis-coding-tools.ts`) mounts the dsh coding stack in dsh-base order; live-verified (bash/read/write/edit/glob/grep/str_replace_editor/todo_write/exit_plan_mode). (`ec8d793c`)
- [ ] **2b — cairn-coding bridge plugin.** Map dsh session/tool/turn events → the `pi-agent:*` IPC vocabulary (token/thought/tool/step/usage/note-updated/todos/plan-note/mode-change). Sibling to `cairn-subagent`. **← NEXT**
- [ ] **2c — Sessions + persistence.** Keep Cairn's `pi_agent_sessions` metadata + `pi_agent_llm_history` (JSON) + display transcript + `pi_session_todos` (no dsh equivalent for SQLite display/todos). Decide dsh jsonl persistence vs Cairn's `saveLlmHistory`/`getLlmHistory`. Stateful `sessions` Map + `runningLoops` + `is-running` stay Cairn-side (or a long-lived per-session Cordis agent).
- [ ] **2d — Plan mode.** `dsh-plan-mode` for the plan/execute gate + read-only PLAN_MODE_ALLOWED toolset; bridge `set-mode`/`approve-plan`/`plan-note`/`mode-change`; reuse Cairn's plan-note PRD prompt via `cairn-system-prompt`.
- [ ] **2e — Approvals (HITL).** `dsh-user-approval` + `dsh-permission-presets`. Bridge `tool-confirm-required` ⇄ `respond-tool` (+grant session/command) + `autoApprove` bypass. Author the `automation-dev` file-only-no-shell preset.
- [ ] **2f — Doom-loop.** No dsh package — reimplement Cairn's rolling `recentToolCalls` + `toolCallSignature` + `DOOM_LOOP_THRESHOLD=3` as a pre-execute hook; bridge `doom-loop` ⇄ `respond-doom-loop`.
- [x] **2g — Questions.** DONE (in the CHAT path first, reusable by coding). Adopted the **`dsh-user-questions`** seam (`ctx.userQuestions`) + `cairnQuestionsPlugin` provider; `ask_questions` tool BLOCKS via `ctx.userQuestions.ask()` and returns answers same-turn. `dsh-tool-ask-user` (model tool) is unpublished, so Cairn keeps its own `ask_questions` tool. Cordis-only description override tells the model the tool blocks+returns (else it wrote "fill the form" and stopped). Renderer: `chat:answer-questions` IPC + `answerQuestions()` + `QuestionForm.onSubmitStructured`; form must NOT be gated on `isLoading` (blocking pauses mid-turn). (`83af0d51`, `bb63771a`, `7f9076a6`) — the coding agent still needs to WIRE this seam into `runCordisCodingLoop` (2b/2e work).
- [ ] **2h — Compaction + retries.** `dsh-compaction-basic` for 80%-context auto-compaction + `/compact` (`compact-now`/`compact`/`compact-result`), or keep Cairn's `buildCompactionTransformer`. Retries via `dsh-llm-retry` → `pi-agent:retry`.
- [ ] **2i — Skills.** `dsh-skill-local` is MISSING (unpublished). Keep Cairn's `discoverSkills`/`renderSkillsXml` + `skill` tool as a `cairn-skills` plugin over the fs.
- [ ] **2j — Sandbox/cwd.** `dsh-fs-sandbox` + `dsh-sandbox-local`/`-policy` scoped to the request `cwd` (`{mode, workspaceRoot}`); preserve the automation-dev traversal restriction.
- [ ] **2k — Missing deps.** `dsh-user-questions` ADDED to package.json (`83af0d51`). Still add `dsh-attachment` before relying on it; re-verify guards + win32-arm64 packaging.
- [ ] Gate behind `CAIRN_ENGINE` like chat; live-test each capability before flipping the coding default.

### Phase 2 — Delete the old loops (parity gate met)
- [ ] Once BOTH chat AND coding parity are proven in production, **delete** `chat-loop.ts`, `chat-subagent-loop.ts`, `pi-agent-loop.ts`, and the toggle.
- [ ] Also port the small remaining built-in callers: `user-style-handlers.ts` (`runToolLoop`) and the automation heartbeat runner.
- [ ] Retire the old loops and their IPC handlers.

### Phase 3 — In-app user plugins (the big unlock, 3–6 weeks)
Users write/install Cordis plugins inside Cairn.
- [ ] A "Plugins" settings tab that manages a patch layer (`cordis.patch.yml`-style) and installs npm packages into a bundled plugin dir.
- [ ] Plugin sandbox: user plugins run in a restricted Node context (limited fs/net) or spawn worker threads — never raw Electron-main access without explicit approval.
- [ ] A plugin authoring surface: editor pane + debug console + live reload (Cordis HMR is already built in).
- [ ] Publish Cairn's own plugins (`cairn-db`, `cairn-tools`) to npm so the ecosystem can build on them.

## 5. What users get

- The entire dsh plugin ecosystem becomes installable in Cairn (as npm settles) — sandboxing, approvals, plan mode, skills, workflows, subagents.
- Cairn keeps its identity: local-first, offline-capable PKM with a polished UI — the engine underneath is swappable, the product layer is untouched.
- Future-proofing: every Cairn feature becomes a plugin; the community registry becomes the storefront for Cairn plugins.

## 6. Risks & mitigations

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-1.0 framework fork as core dep; compat-breaking promised | High | Pin exact versions; upgrade on Cairn's schedule; vendor/fork if a fix stalls (dsh's own pattern). |
| npm publish set incomplete (missing 4+ packages) | High | Phase 0 baseline snapshot; vendor missing pieces; track upstream publishing. |
| Version drift across rc lines | High | Never trust ranges; pin the coherent lockfile snapshot. |
| Adapter fidelity for interactive UX (streaming tokens, subagent blocks, question forms) | Medium | Map dsh events → existing IPC event shapes (spike validated the vocab exists); keep Built-in loop as fallback. |
| Electron runtime compatibility | Low | dsh targets Node 22.19+; Electron 43 ships Node 22 — verified compatible. |
| Tool schema migration (~45 tools) | Medium | Mechanical conversion from Zod → ValueSchemaSpec; the pipeline enforces output schemas we already have. |

## 7. Decision log

- 2026-08-19: Spikes pass. Chose in-process Cordis tree over ACP sidecar (no subprocess, no protocol loss, tool execution stays on the real DB handle). Adopt behind a toggle, not a replacement.
- 2026-08-19: Cordis is the DEFAULT engine; built-in loops frozen (env `CAIRN_ENGINE=builtin` or `localllm` provider only). Chat path fully ported + live-verified.
- 2026-08-19: Wire protocol is auto-selected per endpoint (reuse `electron/lib/llm-transport.ts` `resolveTransport` probe-and-cache + `markCompletionsOnly` runtime fallback) — no hardcoded/persisted protocol.
- 2026-08-19: `dsh-llm-pi-ai` is the adapter = a thin wrapper over `@earendil-works/pi-ai` (a 3rd-party unified multi-provider LLM client). It sits BELOW the standard `dsh-agent`/`dsh-agent-loop` — it is NOT an agent. No `dsh-pi-agent` package exists.
- 2026-08-19: Questions adopt the `dsh-user-questions` SEAM (blocking, same-turn) but keep Cairn's `ask_questions` TOOL because the model-facing `dsh-tool-ask-user` package is unpublished.

## 8. Session handoff — resume here

**Branch:** `feat/cordis-runtime` · **Latest commit:** `7f9076a6` · tree clean.

**Where we are:** Phase 1 (chat) is DONE and shipping as the default engine. Phase 1.5 (port the coding agent) is underway: **2a done** (coding toolset), **2g done** (questions, in the chat path). **Next: 2b** — the `cairn-coding` bridge plugin.

**Key files (all under `electron/cordis/`):**
- `run-cordis-loop.ts` — the chat loop (`runCordisLoop`). Boots the shared Cordis tree in `getContext()`; mounts pi-ai adapter (`ensurePiAiAdapter`, protocol from `resolveTransport`); mounts `cairn-*` plugins per call; `runTurn()` with the responses→completions runtime fallback; live token/reasoning streaming via a `session/event` listener scoped to `currentAttemptSessionId`.
- `cairn-plugins.ts` — `cairnDbPlugin` (owns Database on `CAIRN_DB`), `cairnSessionPlugin`, `cairnUsagePlugin`, `cairnSubagentPlugin` (child `origin:'subagent'` → `chat:subagent*`; text/reasoning kept disjoint), `cairnSystemPromptPlugin` (`inject:['systemPrompt']`), `cairnQuestionsPlugin` (`inject:['userQuestions']`).
- `cairn-tools.ts` — `registerCairnTools` (~56 data tools via `buildCairnTool` → `executeTool`; **ask_questions overridden** to `ctx.userQuestions.ask()` + a Cordis-only description), `registerExternalCairnTools` (user MCP/services).
- `cordis-coding-tools.ts` — `mountCodingStack(ctx,{cwd})` — the dsh coding capability stack (step 2a).
- Live tests (gated `CORDIS_LIVE=1`, need `CORDIS_DUMMY_KEY=local` + the bridge at `localhost:3042`): `pi.live.test.ts` (chat+history+streaming), `subagent.live.test.ts` (thinking/brief split), `questions.live.test.ts` (blocking same-turn), `coding.live.test.ts` (coding stack).

**How to run:**
- Full electron suite: `npx vitest run electron` (85+ files, ~1151 tests, must stay green).
- Live Cordis tests: `CORDIS_LIVE=1 CORDIS_DUMMY_KEY=local npx vitest run electron/cordis/<file> --testTimeout=90000` (needs the Rork bridge running at `http://localhost:3042/v1`).
- Rebuild bundle after Electron changes: `npm run compile`; type-check: `npm run type-check:all` (ignore `scratch/dsh-repo/*` errors — gitignored clone).

**Gotchas / hard-won facts:**
- dsh capability seams (`ctx.systemPrompt`, `ctx.userQuestions`, …) are gated: a plugin must set `plugin.inject = ["<seam>"]` or you get "cannot get property X without inject".
- dsh throws on duplicate prompt-section names → `cairnSystemPromptPlugin` uses a unique `cairn:system:<id>` per mount.
- `cairnDbPlugin` is idempotent (skip `provide` if `CAIRN_DB` present) — its disposer is async, so back-to-back turns can re-mount before teardown.
- esbuild is stricter than tsc — avoid deeply-nested inline function-type casts (extract to a named interface) or you get a PARSE_ERROR at bundle time only.
- `import.meta.url` in bundled ESM deps is handled by the banner+define in `package.json`/`scripts/build.js` (`globalThis.__cairnImportMetaUrl`) — don't remove it.
- The renderer question form must NOT be gated on `isLoading` (a blocking ask_questions pauses the turn mid-flight).
- The `ask_questions` tool needs the Cordis-only description telling the model it BLOCKS and RETURNS answers, else the model writes a "fill in the form" sign-off and stops.

**Next concrete step (2b):** create `cairnCodingPlugin` in `cairn-plugins.ts` (sibling to `cairnSubagentPlugin`) mapping the MAIN coding session's dsh events → `pi-agent:*` IPC (token/thought/tool/step/usage/note-updated/todos/plan-note/mode-change), and scaffold `runCordisCodingLoop` (new file, mirroring `runCordisLoop` but using `mountCodingStack` + the pi-agent IPC contract). Gate it behind `CAIRN_ENGINE` and DO NOT touch `electron/ipc/pi-agent.ts`'s builtin path yet. Full audit of the pi-agent contract is in the note "DeepSeek Harness (dsh) integration analysis".
